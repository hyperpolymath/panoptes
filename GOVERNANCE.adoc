== Overview

This document describes the governance model for the Panoptes project. We follow a Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) model with community input through the Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF).

== Decision Making

=== BDFL Model

Jonathan D. A. Jewell serves as the project BDFL with final authority on:

* Technical direction
* Release decisions
* Conflict resolution
* Maintainer appointments

=== Consensus Seeking

For day-to-day decisions, we seek consensus among active contributors:

1. Proposals are made via GitLab Issues or Merge Requests
2. Discussion period of at least 72 hours for non-trivial changes
3. If consensus cannot be reached, BDFL makes final decision

== Roles and Responsibilities

=== Maintainers (Perimeter 1 - Core)

Maintainers have:

* Write access to the repository
* Authority to merge pull requests
* Responsibility for release management
* Duty to uphold code quality standards

Current maintainers are listed in link:MAINTAINERS.md[MAINTAINERS.md].

=== Trusted Contributors (Perimeter 2 - Expert)

Trusted contributors have demonstrated:

* Understanding of project goals and standards
* Consistent quality contributions
* Adherence to code of conduct

Trusted contributors may:

* Have merge requests fast-tracked
* Be consulted on technical decisions
* Be invited to become maintainers

=== Community Contributors (Perimeter 3 - Community)

All community members may:

* Submit issues and merge requests
* Participate in discussions
